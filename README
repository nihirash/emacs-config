Mine EMACS config.
==================

There first usable for me config of emacs editor.

I using HHKB Pro keyboard and remaped some keys for more comfort editing in emacs.

What keys I using?

 - CUA keys for copy/cut/paste
 - META+hjkl for moving cursor. This is really nice combination.
 - META+CTRL+h - for backward word
 - META+CTRL+l - for forward word
 - META+CTRL+jk - for page up/down
 - CTRL+TAB - next window
 - CTRL+w - close current window
 - CTRL+s - save buffer
 - CTRL+META+s - save as buffer
 - CTRL+o - for open/create file(calls ido-find-file)
 - CTRL+p - for toggling speedbar
